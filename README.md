Hi there — I’m Karttikeya. I build things close to the metal.

I'm a Computer Science undergrad at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology with a focus on systems programming, security, and building tools that don't just run — they *matter*. I love tinkering with the lower layers of software: compilers, interpreters, access control systems, and tools that make the developer experience smoother and more secure.

## 🔭 Projects I'm working on

- **🛡️ [Gatekeep](https://github.com/biscuitrescue/gatekeep)**  
  GitHub-style access control for SSH servers. Define `authorized_keys` access in YAML, track changes via Git, and sync with a secure systemd daemon. Written in Rust.

- **🌀 [rsvcs](https://github.com/biscuitrescue/rsvcs)**  
  A minimal version control system that teaches the fundamentals of how Git-like tools work under the hood — built for clarity, not complexity.

- **🧮 [drag](https://github.com/biscuitrescue/drag)**  
  A toy compiler and interpreter exploring expression evaluation, inspired by Rust's syntax and powered by C++. It's a project to dive deep into language design and compilation.

## 🧠 Currently learning

- Writing secure system daemons and privilege separation
- How real compilers optimize code (beyond syntax)
- Designing portable tools for infrastructure and config validation
- Rewriting tooling and workflows from scratch in Rust, just to understand them better
